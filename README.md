## Complexity Analysis for Balanced Brackets Code

1. Time Complexity: O(n)

   * The function iterates through each character of the input string s exactly once.
   * For every character, the operations conducted, such as inspecting whether itâ€™s a whitespace character or a push/pull operation with the stack, are considered to be O(1) time complexity operations.
   * So, if n in this case is the size of the input string, the time complexity in total is O(n).

2. Space Complexity: O(n)

   * The space complexity arises from the use of a stack to store the opening brackets.
   * In the worst-case scenario, where all characters in the string are opening brackets, we may need to store all of them in the stack.
   * As a result, the space usage is proportional to the number of brackets in the input string, leading to a space complexity of O(n) in the worst case.

**Summary**
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(n)


All Test is following rules of case. Thank You.
